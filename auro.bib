@article{Herzog2014,
	abstract = "The ability to grasp unknown objects is an important skill for personal robots, which has been addressed by many present and past research projects, but still remains an open problem. A crucial aspect of grasping is choosing an appropriate grasp configuration, i.e. the 6d pose of the hand relative to the object and its finger configuration. Finding feasible grasp configurations for novel objects, however, is challenging because of the huge variety in shape and size of these objects. Moreover, possible configurations also depend on the specific kinematics of the robotic arm and hand in use. In this paper, we introduce a new grasp selection algorithm able to find object grasp poses based on previously demonstrated grasps. Assuming that objects with similar shapes can be grasped in a similar way, we associate to each demonstrated grasp a grasp template. The template is a local shape descriptor for a possible grasp pose and is constructed using 3d information from depth sensors. For each new object to grasp, the algorithm then finds the best grasp candidate in the library of templates. The grasp selection is also able to improve over time using the information of previous grasp attempts to adapt the ranking of the templates. We tested the algorithm on two different platforms, the Willow Garage PR2 and the Barrett WAM arm which have very different hands. Our results show that the algorithm is able to find good grasp configurations for a large set of objects from a relatively small set of demonstrations, and does indeed improve its performance over time.",

@article{Jiang2011,
	abstract = "Given an image and an aligned depth map of an object, our goal is to estimate the full 7-dimensional gripper configuration\&\#x2014;its 3D location, 3D orientation and the gripper opening width. Recently, learning algorithms have been successfully applied to grasp novel objects\&\#x2014;ones not seen by the robot before. While these approaches use low-dimensional representations such as a \&\#x2018;grasping point\&\#x2019; or a \&\#x2018;pair of points\&\#x2019; that are perhaps easier to learn, they only partly represent the gripper configuration and hence are sub-optimal. We propose to learn a new \&\#x2018;grasping rectangle\&\#x2019; representation: an oriented rectangle in the image plane. It takes into account the location, the orientation as well as the gripper opening width. However, inference with such a representation is computationally expensive. In this work, we present a two step process in which the first step prunes the search space efficiently using certain features that are fast to compute. For the remaining few cases, the second step uses advanced features to accurately select a good grasp. In our extensive experiments, we show that our robot successfully uses our algorithm to pick up a variety of novel objects.",

@misc{Saxena2008,
	abstract = "We consider the problemof grasping novel objects, specifically ones that are being seen for the first time through vision. Grasping a previously un- known object, one for which a 3-d model is not available, is a challenging problem. Further, even if given a model, one still has to decide where to grasp the object. We present a learning algorithm that neither requires, nor tries to build, a 3-d model of the object. Given two (ormore) images of an ob- ject, our algorithmattempts to identify a few points in each image corresponding to good locations at which to grasp the object. This sparse set of points is then triangulated to obtain a 3-d location atwhich to attempt a grasp. This is in contrast to standard dense stereo, which tries to triangulate every single point in an image (and often fails to return a good 3-d model). Our algorithm for identifying grasp locations from an image is trained via supervised learning, using synthetic images for the training set. We demonstrate this approach on two robotic ma- nipulation platforms. Our algorithm successfully grasps a wide variety of objects, such as plates, tape-rolls, jugs, cellphones, keys, screwdrivers, sta- plers, a thick coil ofwire, a strangely shaped power horn, and others, none of which were seen in the training set. We also apply our method to the task of unloading items from dishwashers.",
