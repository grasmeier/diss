  Abstract                 = {We present a novel and simple experimental method called physical human interactive guidance to study human-planned grasping. Instead of studying how the human uses his/her own biological hand or how a human teleoperates a robot hand in a grasping task, the method involves a human interacting physically with a robot arm and hand, carefully moving and guiding the robot into the grasping pose, while the robot{\^{a}}€™s configuration is recorded. Analysis of the grasps from this simple method has produced two interesting results. First, the grasps produced by this method perform better than grasps generated through a state-of-the-art automated grasp planner. Second, this method when combined with a detailed statistical analysis using a variety of grasp measures (physics-based heuristics considered critical for a good grasp) offered insights into how the human grasping method is similar or different from automated grasping synthesis techniques. Specifically, data from the physical human interactive guidance method showed that the human-planned grasping method provides grasps that are similar to grasps from a state-of-the-art automated grasp planner, but differed in one key aspect. The robot wrists were aligned with the object{\^{a}}€™s principal axes in the human-planned grasps (termed low skewness in this paper), while the automated grasps used arbitrary wrist orientation. Preliminary tests show that grasps with low skewness were significantly more robust than grasps with high skewness (77{\^{a}}€“93{\%}). We conclude with a detailed discussion of how the physical human interactive guidance method relates to existing methods to extract the human principles for physical interaction.

A real time peg in hole experiment involving a PUMA 761 industrial manipulator is detailed to support the theoretical results.},

  Abstract                 = {key goal in dextrous robotic hand grasping is to balance external forces and at the same time achieve grasp stabil- ity and minimum grasping energy by choosing an appropriate set of internal grasping forces. Since it appears that there is no direct algebraic optimization approach, a recursive optimization, which is adaptive for application in a dynamic environment, is required. One key observation in this paper is that friction force limit constraints and force balancing constraints are equivalent to the positive definiteness of a certain matrix subject to linear constraints. Based on this observation, we formulate the task of grasping force optimization as an optimization problem on the smooth manifold of linearly constrained positive defmite matrices for which there are known globally exponentially convergent solutions via gradient flows. There are a number of versions depending on the Riemannian metric chosen, each with its ad- vantages. Schemes involving second derivative information for quadratic convergence are also studied. Several forms of constrained gradient flows are developed for point contact and soft-finger contact friction models. The physical meaning of the cost index used for the gradient flows is discussed in the context of grasping force optimization. A discretized ver- sion for real-time applicability is presented. Numerical examples demonstrate the simplicity, the good numerical properties, and optimality of the approach.},

  Abstract                 = {Due to pose uncertainty, merely executing a planned-to-be stable grasp usually results in an unstable grasp in the physical world. In our previous work [1], we proposed a tactile experience based grasping pipeline which utilizes tactile feedback to adjust hand posture during the grasping task of known objects and improves the performance of robotic grasping under pose uncertainty. In this paper, we extend our work to grasp novel objects by utilizing local geometric similarity. To do this, we select a series of shape primitives to parameterize potential local geometries which novel objects may share in common. We then build a tactile experience database that stores information of stable grasps on these local geometries. Using this tactile experience database, our method is able to guide a grasp adjustment process to grasp novel objects around similar local geometries. Experiments indicate that our approach improves the grasping performance on novel objects with similar local geometries under pose uncertainty.},

  Abstract                 = {We deal with the problem of blind grasping where we use tactile feedback to predict the stability of a robotic grasp given no visual or geometric information about the object being grasped. We first simulated tactile feedback using a soft finger contact model in GraspIt! [1] and computed tactile contacts of thousands of grasps with a robotic hand using the Columbia Grasp Database [2]. We used the K-means clustering method to learn a contact dictionary from the tactile contacts, which is a codebook that models the contact space. The feature vector for a grasp is a histogram computed based on the distribution of its contacts over the contact space defined by the dictionary. An SVM is then trained to predict the stability of a robotic grasp given this feature vector. Experiments indicate that this model which requires low-dimension feature input is useful in predicting the stability of a grasp.},

  Abstract                 = {Service robots require easy programming methods allowing the unexperienced human user to easily integrate motion and perception skills or complex problem solving strategies. To achieve this goal, robots should learn from operators how and what to do considering hard- and software constraints. Various approaches modelling the man-machine skill transfer have been proposed. Systems following the Programming by Demonstration (PbD) paradigm that were developed within the last decade are getting closer to this goal. However, most of these systems lack the possibility for the user to supervise and influence the process of program generation after the initial demonstration was performed. In this paper a principle learning methodology is discussed, which allows to transfer human skills and to supervise the learning process including subsymbolic and symbolic task knowledge. Here, several existing approaches will be discussed and compared to each other. Moreover, a system approach is presented, integrating the overall process of skill transfer from a human to a robotic manipulation system. One major goal is to modify information gained by the demonstration in that way that different target systems are supported. The resulting PbDsystem yields towards a hybrid learning approach in robotics to support natural programming based on human demonstrations and user advice.},

  Abstract                 = {We propose a planning method for grasping in cluttered environments, a method where the robot can make simultaneous contact with multiple objects. With this method, the robot reaches for and grasps the target while simultaneously contacting and moving aside objects to clear a desired path. We use a physics-based analysis of pushing to compute the motion of each object in the scene in response to a set of possible robot motions. Our method enables multiple robot- object interactions, interactions that can be pre-computed and cached. However, our method avoids object-object interactions to make the problem computationally tractable. Through tests on large sets of simulated scenes, we show that our planner produces more successful grasps in more complex scenes than versions that avoid any interaction with surrounding clutter. We validate our method on a real robot, a PR2, and show that it accurately predicts the outcome of a grasp. We also show that our approach, in conjunction with state-of-the-art object recognition tools, is applicable in real-life scenes that are highly cluttered and constrained.},

This research shows that the typical or standard CSBAT (Connection Semantics Based Assembly Tree) can be applied to a given assembly problem. The structure of the KBASP (Knowledge-Based Assembly Sequence Planning System) is proposed, there are three ways to construct plans for a CSBAT: (I) by retrievirzg the typical base, (2) by retrieving standard base, and (3) by geometry reasoning. Compared with other system based on the reuse philosophy, the approach can generate assembly sequences for each CSBAT directly without the problem of merging plans for different child CSBATS. By integrating geometry-based reasoning with knowledge-based reasoning, the computation Complexity is reduced drastically and the assembly sequences obtained are more feasible andpractical.}

A CCD camera mounted on the robot end-effector constructs the visually guided servo control system and the control scheme lends itself to task-level specification of manipulation goals by the visual vectors. The grasping task is to control the robot so that the vectors of the end-effector's finger and of a target object's grasp coincide. These vectors can be used to represent the work of a stable grasping of an object that is presented in an unstructured manner These visual vectors in image frame are obtained by analyzing the object's image and projection. The objective of vector processing is to estimate the error between the finger and grasp vectors, and to control the robot in order to eliminate kinematic errors},

  Abstract                 = {Planning realizable and stable grasps on 3D objects is crucial for many robotics applications, but grasp planners often ignore the relative sizes of the robotic hand and the object being grasped or do not account for physical joint and positioning limitations. We present a grasp planner that can consider the full range of parameters of a real hand and an arbitrary object, including physical and material properties as well as environmental obstacles and forces, and produce an output grasp that can be immediately executed. We do this by decomposing a 3D model into a superquadric 'decomposition tree' which we use to prune the intractably large space of possible grasps into a subspace that is likely to contain many good grasps. This subspace can be sampled and evaluated in GraspIt!, our 3D grasping simulator, to find a set of highly stable grasps, all of which are physically realizable. We show grasp results on various models using a Barrett hand.},

  Abstract                 = {The ability to grasp unknown objects is an important skill for personal robots, which has been addressed by many present and past research projects, but still remains an open problem. A crucial aspect of grasping is choosing an appropriate grasp configuration, i.e. the 6d pose of the hand relative to the object and its finger configuration. Finding feasible grasp configurations for novel objects, however, is challenging because of the huge variety in shape and size of these objects. Moreover, possible configurations also depend on the specific kinematics of the robotic arm and hand in use. In this paper, we introduce a new grasp selection algorithm able to find object grasp poses based on previously demonstrated grasps. Assuming that objects with similar shapes can be grasped in a similar way, we associate to each demonstrated grasp a grasp template. The template is a local shape descriptor for a possible grasp pose and is constructed using 3d information from depth sensors. For each new object to grasp, the algorithm then finds the best grasp candidate in the library of templates. The grasp selection is also able to improve over time using the information of previous grasp attempts to adapt the ranking of the templates. We tested the algorithm on two different platforms, the Willow Garage PR2 and the Barrett WAM arm which have very different hands. Our results show that the algorithm is able to find good grasp configurations for a large set of objects from a relatively small set of demonstrations, and does indeed improve its performance over time.},

It considerably increases the automation levels of tasks typically conducted by human workers.

In this paper, we present a complete system for automated kitting with a mobile manipulator thereby focusing on depalletizing tasks and placing. In order to allow for low cycle times, we present particularly efficient solutions to object perception as well as motion planning and execution. For easy portability to different platforms, all components are integrated into a skill-based framework that is tightly coupled with a task planning component. We present results of experiments at both a research laboratory environment and at the industrial site of PSA Peugeot Citro¨en serving as a proof of concept for the overall system design and implementation.},

An assembly skill is represented by a hybrid dynamic system where a discrete event controller models the skill at the task level. The output of the discrete event controller provides the reference commands for the underlying robot controller. This structure is naturally encoded by a hidden Markov model (HMM). The HMM parameters are obtained by training on sensory data from human demonstrations of the skill. Currently, assembly tasks have to be performed by human operators or by robots using expensive fixtures. Our approach transfers the assembly skill from an expert human operator to the robot, thus making it possible for a robot to perform assembly tasks without the use of expensive fixtures},

  Abstract                 = {In this study, we developed a knowledge-based engineering (KBE) system to assist engineers in promptly predicting a near-optimal assembly sequence. A three-stage assembly optimization approach with some heuristic work- ing rules was employed to establish the proposed system. In the first stage, Above Graph and a transforming rule were used to create a correct explosion graph of the assembly models. In the second stage, a three-level relational model graph, with geometric constraints and assembly precedence diagrams, was generated to create a completely relational model graph, an incidence matrix, and a feasible assembly sequence. In the third stage, a robust back-propagation neural network engine was developed and embedded in the Siemens NX system. System users can easily access the volume, weight, and feature number through the Siemens NX system interface, input the related parameters such as contact relationship number and total penalty value, and predict a feasible assembly sequence via a robust engine. Three real-world examples were used to evaluate the feasibility of the KBE system. The results show that the proposed system can facilitate feasible assembly sequences and allow designers to recognize contact relationships, assembly difficulties, and assembly constraints of three- dimensional components in a virtual environment type.},

  Abstract                 = {Thinking about intelligent robots involves consideration of how such systems can be enabled to perceive, interpret and act in arbitrary and dynamic environments. While sensor perception and model interpretation focus on the robot's internal representation of the world rather passively, robot grasping capabilities are needed to actively execute tasks, modify scenarios and thereby reach versatile goals. These capabilities should also include the generation of stable grasps to safely handle even objects unknown to the robot. We believe that the key to this ability is not to select a good grasp depending on the identification of an object (e.g. as a cup), but on its shape (e.g. as a composition of shape primitives). In this paper, we envelop given 3D data points into primitive box shapes by a fit-and-split algorithm that is based on an efficient Minimum Volume Bounding Box implementation. Though box shapes are not able to approximate arbitrary data in a precise manner, they give efficient clues for planning grasps on arbitrary objects. We present the algorithm and experiments using the 3D grasping simulator Grasplt!.},

Recently, learning algorithms have been successfully applied to grasp novel objects\&\#x2014;ones not seen by the robot before. While these approaches use low-dimensional representations such as a \&\#x2018;grasping point\&\#x2019; or a \&\#x2018;pair of points\&\#x2019; that are perhaps easier to learn, they only partly represent the gripper configuration and hence are sub-optimal. We propose to learn a new \&\#x2018;grasping rectangle\&\#x2019; representation: an oriented rectangle in the image plane. It takes into account the location, the orientation as well as the gripper opening width. However, inference with such a representation is computationally expensive. In this work, we present a two step process in which the first step prunes the search space efficiently using certain features that are fast to compute. For the remaining few cases, the second step uses advanced features to accurately select a good grasp. In our extensive experiments, we show that our robot successfully uses our algorithm to pick up a variety of novel objects.},

  Abstract                 = {A scheme for learning to grasp objects using visual information is presented. The learning problem is divided into two separate subproblems: choosing grasping points and predicting the quality of a given grasp. For each grasp we store location parameters that code the locations of the grasping points, quality parameters that are relevant features for the assessment of grasp quality, and the associated grade. The location parameters, using a special coding which is not object specific, are used to locate grasping points on new target objects. A function from the quality parameters to the grade is learned from examples. Grasp quality for novel situations can be generalized and estimated using the learned function. An experimental setup using an AdeptOne manipulator was developed to test this scheme. The system had demonstrated an ability to grasp a relatively wide variety of objects, and its performance had significantly improved with practice following a small number of trials. The knowledge learned for a set of objects was successfully generalized to new objects},

  Abstract                 = {Although there has been great progress in robot grasp planning, automatically generated grasp sets using a quality metric are not as robust as human-generated grasp sets when applied to real problems. Most previous research on grasp quality metrics has focused on measuring the quality of established grasp contacts after grasping, but it is difficult to reproduce the same planned final grasp configuration with a real robot hand, which makes the quality evaluation less useful in practice. In this study, we focus more on the grasping process, which usually involves changes in contact and object location, and explore the efficacy of using dynamic simulation in estimating the likely success or failure of a grasp in the real environment. Among many factors that can possibly affect the result of grasping, we particularly investigated the effect of considering object dynamics and pose uncertainty on the performance in estimating the actual grasp success rates measured from experiments. We observed that considering both dynamics and uncertainty improved the performance significantly, and when applied to automatic grasp set generation, this method generated more stable and natural grasp sets compared with a commonly used method based on kinematic simulation and force-closure analysis.},

  Abstract                 = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

  Abstract                 = {Having presented both theoretical and practical reasons for artificial intelligence to use probabilistic reasoning, we now introduce the key computer technology for deal-ing with probabilities in AI, namely Bayesian networks. Bayesian networks (BNs) are graphical models for reasoning under uncertainty, where the nodes represent vari-ables (discrete or continuous) and arcs represent direct connections between them. These direct connections are often causal connections. In addition, BNs model the quantitative strength of the connections between variables, allowing probabilistic be-liefs about them to be updated automatically as new information becomes available. In this chapter we will describe how Bayesian networks are put together (the syntax) and how to interpret the information encoded in a network (the semantics). We will look at how to model a problem with a Bayesian network and the types of reasoning that can be performed. 2.2 Bayesian network basics A Bayesian network is a graphical structure that allows us to represent and reason about an uncertain domain. The nodes in a Bayesian network represent a set of ran-dom variables, X = X 1 , ..X i , ...X n , from the domain. A set of directed arcs (or links) connects pairs of nodes, X i → X j , representing the direct dependencies between vari-ables. Assuming discrete variables, the strength of the relationship between variables is quantified by conditional probability distributions associated with each node. The only constraint on the arcs allowed in a BN is that there must not be any directed cy-cles: you cannot return to a node simply by following directed arcs. Such networks are called directed acyclic graphs, or simply dags. There are a number of steps that a knowledge engineer 1 must undertake when building a Bayesian network. At this stage we will present these steps as a sequence; however it is important to note that in the real-world the process is not so simple. In Chapter 10 we provide a fuller description of BN knowledge engineering. 1 Knowledge engineer in the jargon of AI means a practitioner applying AI technology.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper introduces a generic framework for sensor-based robot motion control. The key contribution is the introduction of an adaptive selection matrix for sensor-based hybrid switched-system control. The overall control systemconsists of multiple sensors and open- and closed-loop controllers, in-between which the adap- tive selection matrix can switch discretely in order to supply command variables for low-level controllers of robotic manipulators.How control signals are chosen, is specified byManipulation Primitives, which constitute the interface to higher-level applications. This programming paradigm is formally specified in order to establish the possibility of executing sensor-guided and sensor-guarded motion commands si- multaneously and in a very open way, such that any kind and any number of sensors can be addressed. A further key feature of this generic approach is, that the control structure can be directly mapped to a corresponding software architecture. The re- sulting control system is freely scalable depending on the performance requirements of the desired system. 1},

Starting with a CAD model of an object to be grasped, the system can find the object's pose through vision which then synchronizes the state of the robot workcell with an online, model-based grasp planning and visualization system we have developed called GraspIt. GraspIt can then plan a stable grasp for the object, and direct the robotic hand system to perform the grasp. It can also generate trajectories for the movement of the grasped object, which are used by the visual control system to monitor the task and compare the actual grasp and trajectory with the planned ones. We present experimental results using typical grasping tasks.},

  Abstract                 = {Vision guided robotics has been one of the major research issue for more than three decades. The more recent technological development facilitated the advancement in the area which has resulted in a number of successful and even commercial systems using offtheshelf hardware. The applications of visually guided systems are many: from intelligent homes to automotive industry. However, one of the open and commonly stated problems in the area is the need for exchange of experiences and research ideas. In our opinion, a good starting point for this is to advertise the successes and propose a common terminology in form of a survey paper. The paper concentrates on different types of visual servoing: image based, position based and 2 1/2D visual servoing. Different issues concerning both the hardware and software requirements are considered and the most prominent contributions are reviewed. The proposed terminology is used to introduce a young researcher and lead the experts in the field through a three decades long historical field of vision guided robotics. We also include a number of realworld examples from our own research providing not only a conceptual framework but also illustrating most of the issues covered in the paper.},

  Abstract                 = {Grasping an object is a task that inherently needs to be treated in a hybrid fashion. The system must decide both where and how to grasp the object. While selecting where to grasp requires learning about the object as a whole, the execution only needs to reactively adapt to the context close to the grasp's location. We propose a hierarchical controller that reflects the structure of these two sub-problems, and attempts to learn solutions that work for both. A hybrid architecture is employed by the controller to make use of various machine learning methods that can cope with the large amount of uncertainty inherent to the task. The controller's upper level selects where to grasp the object using a reinforcement learner, while the lower level comprises an imitation learner and a vision-based reactive controller to determine appropriate grasping motions. The resulting system is able to quickly learn good grasps of a novel object in an unstructured environment, by executing smooth reaching motions and preshaping the hand depending on the object's geometry. The system was evaluated both in simulation and on a real robot. 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

In the framework, grasp and object attributes, on-line sensor information and the stability of a grasp are all considered through probabilistic models. We describe how sensor-based grasp planning can be formulated in a probabilistic framework and how information about object attributes can be updated simultaneously using on-line sensor information gained during grasping. The framework is demonstrated by building the necessary probabilistic models using Gaussian process regression, and using the models with an MCMC approach to estimate a target object’s pose and grasp stability during grasp attempts. The framework is also demonstrated on a real robotic platform.},

  Abstract                 = {We describe a learning-based approach to hand-eye coordination for robotic grasping from monocular images. To learn hand-eye coordination for grasping, we trained a large convolutional neural network to predict the probability that task-space motion of the gripper will result in successful grasps, using only monocular camera images and independently of camera calibration or the current robot pose. This requires the network to observe the spatial relationship between the gripper and objects in the scene, thus learning hand-eye coordination. We then use this network to servo the gripper in real time to achieve successful grasps. To train our network, we collected over 800,000 grasp attempts over the course of two months, using between 6 and 14 robotic manipulators at any given time, with differences in camera placement and hardware. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that our method achieves effective real-time control, can successfully grasp novel objects, and corrects mistakes by continuous servoing.},

  Abstract                 = {To perform robust grasping, a multi-fingered robotic hand should be able to adapt its grasping configuration, i.e., how the object is grasped, to maintain the stability of the grasp. Such a change of grasp configuration is called grasp adaptation and it depends on the controller, the employed sensory feedback and the type of uncertainties inherit to the problem. This paper proposes a grasp adaptation strategy to deal with uncertainties about physical properties of objects, such as the object weight and the friction at the contact points. Based on an object-level impedance controller, a grasp stability estimator is first learned in the object frame. Once a grasp is predicted to be unstable by the stability estimator, a grasp adaptation strategy is triggered according to the similarity between the new grasp and the training examples. Experimental results demonstrate that our method improves the grasping performance on novel objects with different physical properties from those used for training. © 2014 IEEE.},

Rather than using a uniformly distributed task wrench space, this paper models a manipulation task with a non-parametric statistical distribution model built from the disturbance data captured during the task demonstrations. The grasp resulting from maximizing the proposed grasp quality criterion is prone to increasing the coverage of most frequent disturbances. To reduce the computational complexity of the search in a high-dimensional robotic hand configuration space, as well as to avoid the correspondence problem, the candidate grasps are computed from a reduced configuration space that is confined by a set of given thumb placements and thumb directions. The proposed approach has been tested both in simulation and on a real robotic system. In simulation, the approach was validated with a Barrett hand and a Shadow hand in several manipulation tasks. Experiments on a physical robotic platform verified the consistency between the proposed grasp metric and the success rate.},

The approach intends to embed naturally the skill learning capability during manufacturing operations (i.e., within a flexible manufacturing system). The integration of machine vision and force sensing has been useful to demonstrate the usefulness of the cognitive architecture to acquire knowledge and to effectively use it to improve its behaviour. Practical results are presented, showing that the robot is able to recognise a given component and to carry out the assembly.

The key idea is to divide the control into several sensor-based control tasks that are simultaneously executed by a general structure called stack of tasks. This structure enables a very simple access for task sequencing, and can be used for task-level control. This framework was applied for a visual servoing task. The robot walks along a planned path, keeping the specified object in the middle of its field of view and finally, when it is close enough, the robot grasps the object while walking.},

We present a unique grasp analysis system that, when given a 3D object, hand, and pose for the hand, can accurately determine the types of contacts that will occur between the links of the hand and the object, and compute two measures of quality for the grasp. Using models of two articulated robotic hands, we analyze several grasps of a polyhedral model of a telephone handset, and we use a novel technique to visualize the 6D space used in these computations. In addition, we demonstrate the possibility of using this system for synthesizing high quality grasps by performing a search over a subset of possible hand configurations},

This can be realized by analyzing hyper-arcs of the underlying AND/OR graphs representing automatically generated assembly plans. Features like local depart spaces, symbolic spatial relations, and the necessary tools classify the type of assembly operation (peg in hole, placements, alignments, etc.). Skill primitives are robot movements or commands for grippers and tools. The unified modeling language is used to model the robot tasks and skill primitives. A robot control system uses the skill primitives as input to select the desired control scheme (position, force, or hybrid). In addition to this, we use an algorithm to identify assembly process states considering static friction under uniform gravity to execute skill primitives. This enables a robot to select and modify its motion strategies adequately according to the state of the assembly operation},

Mainly, there are two types of camera utilization for visual servoing: eye-in-hand and eye-to-hand configurations. Both have own merits and drawbacks regarding to precision and view limit that oppose each other. Based on both behaviors, this paper employs a mobile manipulator as the second robot to hold the camera. Here, the camera architecture is eye-to-hand configuration for the main robot, but mainly behaves as eye-in-hand configuration for the second robot. Having this framework, the drawback of each configuration is resolved by the benefit of the other. Here, the camera becomes mobile with more precision and global view. In addition, since there is no additional camera, the vision algorithm can be kept simple. In order to gain real-time visual servoing, this paper also addresses real-time constraints on vision system and data communication between robot and vision. Here, a hexagon pattern of artificial marker with a simplified image processing is developed. A grasp positioning problem is considered with position-based dynamic look and move visual control through object pose estimation. The system performance is validated by the experimental result.},

  Abstract                 = { Understanding the principles of motor coordination with redundant degrees of freedom still remains a challenging problem, particularly for new research in highly redundant robots like humanoids. Even after more than a decade of research, task space control with redundacy resolution still remains an incompletely understood theoretical topic, and also lacks a larger body of thorough experimental investigation on complex robotic systems. This paper presents our first steps towards the development of a working redundancy resolution algorithm which is robust against modeling errors and unforeseen disturbances arising from contact forces. To gain a better understanding of the pros and cons of different approaches to redundancy resolution, we focus on a comparative empirical evaluation. First, we review several redundancy resolution schemes at the velocity, acceleration and torque levels presented in the literature in a common notational framework and also introduce some new variants of these previous approaches. Second, we present experimental comparisons of these approaches on a seven-degree-of-freedom anthropomorphic robot arm. Surprisingly, one of our simplest algorithms empirically demonstrates the best performance, despite, from a theoretical point, the algorithm does not share the same beauty as some of the other methods. Finally, we discuss practical properties of these control algorithms, particularly in light of inevitable modeling errors of the robot dynamics.},

The target task is navigation in which a person with his or her eyes covered and a humanoid robot collaborate in a context-dependent manner. The robot uses a recurrent neural net with parametric bias (RNNPB) model to acquire the behavioral primitives, which are sensory-motor units, composing the whole task. The robot expresses the PB dynamics as primitives using symbolic sounds, and the person influences these dynamics through tactile sensors attached to the robot. Experiments with six participants demonstrated that the level of influence the person has on the PB dynamics is strongly related to task performance, the person’s subjective impressions, and the prediction error of the RNNPB model (task stability). Simulation experiments demonstrated that the subjective impressions of the correspondence between the utterance sounds (the PB values) and the motions were well reproduced by the rehearsal of the RNNPB model.},

  Abstract                 = {Learning complex motor skills for real world tasks is a hard problem in robotic manipulation that often requires painstaking manual tuning and design by a human expert. In this work, we present a Reinforcement Learning based approach to acquiring new motor skills from demonstration. Our approach allows the robot to learn fine manipulation skills and significantly improve its success rate and skill level starting from a possibly coarse demonstration. Our approach aims to incorporate task domain knowledge, where appropriate, by working in a space consistent with the constraints of a specific task. In addition, we also present an approach to using sensor feedback to learn a predictive model of the task outcome. This allows our system to learn the proprioceptive sensor feedback needed to monitor subsequent executions of the task online and abort execution in the event of predicted failure. We illustrate our approach using two example tasks executed with the PR2 dual-arm robot: a straight and accurate pool stroke and a box flipping task using two chopsticks as tools.},

  Abstract                 = {Many supporting activities that future service robots might perform in people's homes depend on the capability to grasp and manipulate arbitrary objects. Easily accomplished by humans, but very difficult to achieve for robots, grasping involves dealing with a high-dimensional space of parameters which include hand kinematics, object geometry, material properties and forces. We believe that the way a robot grasps an object should be motivated by the object's geometry and that the search space for stable grasps can be dramatically reduced if the underlying object representation reflects symmetry properties of the object that contain valuable information for grasp planning. In this paper, we introduce the grid of medial spheres, a volumetric object representation based on the medial axis transform. The grid of medial spheres represents arbitrarily shaped objects with arbitrary levels of detail and contains symmetry information that can be easily exploited by a grasp planning algorithm. We present the data structure as well as a grasp planning algorithm that exploits it and provide experimental results on various object models using two robot hands in simulation.},

  Abstract                 = {We consider the task of grasping novel objects and cleaning fairly cluttered tables with many novel objects. Recent successful approaches employ machine learning algorithms to identify points on the scene that the robot should grasp. In this paper, we show that the task can be significantly simplified by using segmentation, especially with depth information. A supervised localization method is employed to select graspable segments. We also propose a shape completion and grasp planner method which takes partial 3D information and plans the most stable grasping strategy. Extensive experiments on our robot demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.},

  Abstract                 = { The positioning of a gripper with respect to an object is one of the basic steps involved in the manipulation of that object. In particular, in a grasping task the fingers of the gripper should be placed at a set of selected grasp points belonging to the object. In this paper, a two-finger gripper and a stereo pair of cameras mounted in an eye-in-hand configuration are considered for this task. A visual servoing control system is proposed for the guidance of the positioning movement in which the grasp points are tracked in image space and used as input features for the control law. This tracking is based on the use of an invariant description of the grasp with respect to the object. The control law is restricted to control the degrees of freedom that produce movements that respect the invariance required by the grasp tracking.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a novel robotic grasp controller that allows a sensorized parallel jaw gripper to gently pick up and set down unknown objects once a grasp location has been selected. Our approach is inspired by the control scheme that humans employ for such actions, which is known to centrally depend on tactile sensation rather than vision or proprioception. Our controller processes measurements from the gripper's fingertip pressure arrays and hand-mounted accelerometer in real time to generate robotic tactile signals that are designed to mimic human SA-I, FA-I, and FA-II channels. These signals are combined into tactile event cues that drive the transitions between six discrete states in the grasp controller: Close, Load, Lift and Hold, Replace, Unload, and Open. The controller selects an appropriate initial grasping force, detects when an object is slipping from the grasp, increases the grasp force as needed, and judges when to release an object to set it down. We demonstrate the promise of our approach through implementation on the PR2 robotic platform, including grasp testing on a large number of real-world objects.},

A metric for the evaluation based on the notion of virtual fingers is proposed. The first part of the experimental evaluation, performed in simulation, shows how the differences in the embodiment between human and robotic hand affect the grasp strategy. The second part, performed with a robotic system, demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed methodology in realistic applications.},

The fingers and the$\backslash$nobject are all treated as elastic bodies, and the region of contact is$\backslash$nmodeled as a deformable surface patch. The relationship between the$\backslash$nfriction and normal forces is now nonlocal and nonlinear in nature and$\backslash$ndeparts from the Coulomb approximation. The nature of the constraints$\backslash$narising out of conditions for compatibility and static equilibrium$\backslash$nmotivated the formulation of the model as a nonlinear constrained$\backslash$nminimization problem. The model is able to predict the magnitude of the$\backslash$ninwardly directed normal forces and both the magnitude and direction of$\backslash$nthe tangential (friction) forces at each finger/object interface for$\backslash$ngrasped objects in static equilibrium. Examples in two and three$\backslash$ndimensions are presented along with an application of the model to the$\backslash$ngrasp transfer maneuver},

The work$\backslash$nfocuses on the problem of teaching robots force-based assembly skills$\backslash$nfrom human demonstration. To avoid position dependencies, force-based$\backslash$ndiscrete states (contact formations) are used to describe qualitatively$\backslash$nhow contact is being made with the environment. Sensorimotor skills are$\backslash$nmodeled using a hybrid control model, which provides a mechanism for$\backslash$ncombining continuous low-level force control with higher-level discrete$\backslash$nevent control. A change in qualitative, discrete state constitutes an$\backslash$nevent and triggers a new control command to the robot, which moves the$\backslash$nassembly toward a new contact formation. In this way, the skill$\backslash$nexecution is not dependent on absolute position but rather responds to$\backslash$nchanges in the force-based qualitative state. Experimental results are$\backslash$npresented which validate the approach and show how skill acquisition can$\backslash$nbe accomplished even with an imperfect demonstration},

DESIGN: Prospective telephone interview of health insurance representatives. LOCATION: A contiguous three-state area (New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut) in the North-east. RESULTS: Almost all of the insurers surveyed cover chiropractic services. Less than half of the insurers reimburse acupuncture, usually for chronic pain management. Coverage for massage therapy is minimal and usually associated with physical therapy or chiropractic treatment. Other CAM services receive negligible coverage. CONCLUSIONS: Current health insurance coverage of CAM is limited essentially to chiropractic medicine, acupuncture and massage therapy. Coverage of CAM is made confusing by different policies, practitioner requirements, and health plans within each carrier.},

  Abstract                 = {Using visual feedback to control the movement of the end-effector is a common approach for robust execution of robot movements in real-world scenarios. Over the years several visual servoing algorithms have been developed and implemented for various types of robot hardware. In this paper, we present a hybrid approach which combines visual estimations with kinematically determined orientations to control the movement of a humanoid arm. The approach has been evaluated with the humanoid robot ARMAR III using the stereo system of the active head for perception as well as the torso and arms equipped with five finger hands for actuation. We show how a robust visual perception is used to control complex robots without any hand-eye calibration. Furthermore, the robustness of the system is improved by estimating the hand position in case of failed visual hand tracking due to lightning artifacts or occlusions. The proposed control scheme is based on the fusion of the sensor channels for visual perception, force measurement and motor encoder data. The combination of these different data sources results in a reactive, visually guided control that allows the robot ARMAR-III to execute grasping tasks in a real-world scenario.},

In this article, a hybrid assembly station is presented, in which an industrial robot can learn new tasks from worker instructions. The learned task is performed by both the robot and the human worker together in a shared workspace. This workspace is monitored using multi-sensory perception for detecting persons as well as objects. The environmental data are processed within the collision avoidance module to provide safety for persons and equipment. The real-time capable software architecture and the orchestration of the involved modules using a knowledge-based system controller is presented. Finally, the functionality is demonstrated within an experimental cell in a real-world production scenario. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  Abstract                 = {An improved ant colony optimization (ACO)-based assembly sequence planning (ASP) method for complex products that combines the advantages of ant colony system (ACS) and max–min ant system (MMAS) and integrates some optimization measures is proposed. The optimization criteria, assembly information models, and components number in case study that reported in the literatures of ACO-based ASP during the past 10 years are reviewed and compared. To reduce tedious manual input of parameters and identify the best sequence easily, the optimization criteria such as directionality, parallelism, continuity, stability, and auxiliary stroke are automatically quantified and integrated into the multi-objective heuristic and fitness functions. On the precondition of geometric feasibility based on interference matrix, several strategies of ACS and MMAS are combined in a max–min ant colony system (MMACS) to improve the convergence speed and sequence quality. Several optimization measures are integrated into the system, among which the performance appraisal method transfers the computing resource from the worst ant to the better one, and the group method makes up the deficiency of solely depending on heuristic searching for all parallel parts in each group. An assembly planning system “AutoAssem” is developed based on Siemens NX, and the effectiveness of each optimization measure is testified through case study. Compared with the methods of priority rules screening, genetic algorithm, and particle swarm optimization, MMACS is verified to have superiority in efficiency and sequence performance.},

These systems are designed for complex tasks to be solved in cooperation by the robot arms. However, the capabilities of the individual robot arms to per- form given tasks or the suitability of a multi-robot system for cooperative tasks cannot be intuitively comprehended. For planning complex tasks or designing robot systems, a rep- resentation of a robot arm's workspace is needed that allows to determine from which directions objects in the workspace can be reached. In this paper, the capability map is presented. It is a representation of a robot arm's kinematic capabilities in its workspace. The capability map is used to compare existing robot arms, to support the design phase of an anthropomorphic robot arm and to enable robot workcell planning.},
